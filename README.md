I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (Electronics and Communication Engineering) (Honors) and a Bachelor of Computer Science from RMIT University. With a strong foundation in both computer science and electronics engineering, I have expertise in programming, particularly in C#, and am proficient in technologies such as Docker and Git. I am passionate about embracing new technologies and continuously expanding my skill set.
I thrive in collaborative environments and am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to research and development teams. As a recent graduate, I have gained extensive experience in team-based projects, serving in both leadership and collaborative roles. Notably, in 2016, I participated in the Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Challenge, which honed my skills in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.

This role has strengthened my technical expertise and ability to deliver impactful software solutions in a professional setting.
My university capstone projects in electronics and computer science centered on developing web applications tailored to client specifications. Throughout these projects, I implemented unit and functional testing to ensure application integrity and produced comprehensive documentation to support future development and maintenance. These experiences have equipped me with the skills necessary to excel in software development and code maintenance roles.
As a diligent and organized professional, I am driven by a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to self-improvement.
I am eager to leverage my technical expertise, collaborative mindset, and dedication to continuous learning to contribute to innovative projects and deliver value to your organization.
