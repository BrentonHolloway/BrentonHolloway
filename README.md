### Hi there, My name is Brenton

### Summary
- I'm currently employed at Think Smart Health as a Full Stack Developer.
- I have completed my Bachelor of Engineering (Electronics and Communication Engineering) (Honours) / Bachelor of Computer Science.
- I have completed my Advanced Diploma of Electronics and Communications Engineering
- I have completed my Certificate II and III in Information Communication Technology

### About Me
I am an engineering graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering (Electronics and Communication Engineering) (Honors) / Bachelor of Computer Science from RMIT University. I am skilled in Computer Science and Electronics Engineering. My preferred programming languages are PHP, HTML, JavaScript, Java, C/C++ and my preferred frameworks and CMS are Laravel, React and WordPress and am familiar with technologies such as Git. I have a keen interest in learning new technologies and languages.

I enjoy collaborative work and am confident I would be an asset to any Research and Development Team. As a recently graduated student I have worked as part of many team projects as both a member and a leader. In 2016 I enjoyed participating in EWB (Engineers Without Borders) Challenge which required communication and collaboration with team members.

My university capstone projects (Electronics and Computer Science) both required a web application to be created according to the clientâ€™s specification. Throughout the development of the application unit, tests and function tests were created to ensure that the integrity of the application was maintained. Documentation was also created to ensure that future developers can maintain and develop the projects. I believe my involvement with the projects has given me the required skills to carry out responsibilities in developing and maintaining code.

I am a hard-working, organised individual with a willingness to learn. I enjoy problem solving and am self-motivated. Last year I developed my own business called Wallaby Websites and worked closely with a client to create and maintain their website. At various times through my studies, I have volunteered my time in extracurricular activities such as teaching primary school students to program robots, LEGO Mindstorm and to create their own basic webpages.
